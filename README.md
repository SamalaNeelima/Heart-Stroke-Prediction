The HEART STROKE PREDICTION dataset provides a valuable resource for
developing ML models aimed at predicting the likelihood of an individual experiencing a heart
stroke. This dataset contains a comprehensive set of features related to individuals'
demographic, lifestyle, and medical characteristics, along with their respective stroke outcomes.


In this project, we aim to explore and analyze the HEART STROKE PREDICTION
dataset using various ML models to build a predictive model capable of identifying individuals
at risk of heart stroke. By leveraging advanced ML techniques, we seek to uncover patterns and
relationships within the data that can aid in accurate prediction and early detection of heart
stroke risk factors.
